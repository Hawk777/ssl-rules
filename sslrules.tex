% This stuff is all about semi-automatically generating the year-to-year diffs.
% All text that is the same from the prior year to the current year should be plain text.
% All text that is removed from the prior year to the current year should be in a \removed command.
% All text that is added from the prior year to the current year should be in a \added command.
% If more complicated stuff is needed, like whole sections deleted from the new year, use \ifdiff.
% It would probably be better to use an environment, but I have no idea how to make an environment that discards its body (as would be needed in the non-diff case for removed text).
% Then the Makefile will automatically build both the main PDF and the diff PDF if told to (by "make sslrules.pdf" and "make diff.pdf").
% When starting to work on a new year, the first thing you do should be to delete all the \removed commands and their contents and the \added commands BUT NOT their contents.
% Old rules files and diffs should still be available be going to a git tag and rebuilding.
