\section{\removed{Appendix B -} Vision Experts}\label{app:vision-experts}

During competitions, vision experts are in charge of the shared vision systems on each field.
The assignment and timing of their service period is allocated by competition organisers.
This must be done in a way that each shared vision system always has at least one vision expert assigned.

\subsection{Duties}
The Vision Expert:
\begin{itemize}
\item checks \added{the} shared vision system hardware and reports any kind of hardware problems to TC members / local organisers
\item does the SSL-Vision calibration procedure whenever needed or when teams request, during setup times
\item does the SSL-Vision calibration or maintenance during a match when referee requests
\item before each match, checks that both teams can receive the SSL-Vision packets properly
\item before each match, checks that both teams use proper standard patterns, that their robot heights are calibrated accurately, and that their received localization data is correct
\item monitors \added{the} shared vision system status during the match and reports any kind of problems to the referee instantly
\item receives complaints from teams about \added{the} shared vision system during the match and, if needed, asks the referee to halt the game to give time to diagnose and fix the problem
\item notifies the referee if there is a non-resolvable complaint from a team regarding the vision system; in this case, the referee has the final authority to rule in any manner within his powers and duties (see \autoref{sec:referee}), including the ability to warn and/or sanction a team for unsporting behavior if the team's requests are unfounded and continue to obstruct the game (see \autoref{subsec:fouls-and-misconduct-disciplinary-sanctions}).
\end{itemize}
