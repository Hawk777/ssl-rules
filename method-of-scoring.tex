\section{The Method of Scoring}\label{sec:method-of-scoring}

\subsection{Goal Scored}
A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goal walls, below the cross bar, provided that no infringement of the Laws of the Game has been committed in the play immediately preceeding this event, by the team scoring the goal.

\subsection{Winning Team}
The team scoring the greater number of goals during a match is the winner.
If both teams score an equal number of goals, or if no goals are scored, the match is drawn.

\subsection{Competition Rules}
For matches ending in a draw, competition rules may state provisions involving extra time, or other procedures approved by the RoboCup Federation to determine the winner of a match.

\subsection*{Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A goal is only scored if the ball has not exceeded a robot height (150mm) between the last kick of an attacker and the time the ball crossed the goal line. The intention of this rule is to reduce `blind` chip kicks on the goal. This rule does not apply to the one-on-one shootout.
\end{enumerate}
