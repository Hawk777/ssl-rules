\section{The Throw-In}\label{sec:throw-in}
A throw-in is a method of restarting play.

A throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the robot who last touched the ball when the whole of the
ball crosses the touch line, either on the ground or in the air.

The procedure, infringements and rules of the throw-in are identical to those of an indirect free
kick (\autoref{sec:free-kicks}) taken from the point 100 mm perpendicular to the touch \added{line} \removed{boundary}
where the ball crossed the touch \added{line} \removed{boundary}.
